# 🐱🐶 Cat & Dog Image Classification App

This is a simple web app built with **Streamlit** that classifies images as either a **cat** or a **dog** using a trained machine learning model. Upload an image, and the app will predict the animal in it!

## 🚀 Demo

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://your-streamlit-app-url)

## 📦 Features

- Upload any image of a cat or dog
- Get instant prediction with confidence score
- Clean and responsive Streamlit UI
- Built with a trained ML model (e.g., logistic regression, CNN, etc.)

## 🧠 Model

The model was trained on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images. It uses basic preprocessing and a simple classifier (you can upgrade to CNN for better accuracy).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on your model)
- PIL / OpenCV for image handling
